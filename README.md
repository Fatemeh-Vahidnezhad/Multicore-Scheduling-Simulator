# Multicore-Scheduling-Simulator
This project presents a Python-based multicore CPU scheduling simulator designed to evaluate the impact of various dynamic scheduling strategies. The simulator models a heterogeneous multicore environment with different core speeds and implements a Round Robin scheduling policy enhanced by several techniques such as burst time prediction, work stealing, starvation protection, and hybrid queue management. Burst time prediction uses an exponential averaging model to intelligently assign tasks to fast or slow cores, aiming to balance workload distribution efficiently.

The simulator dynamically adapts to idle cores by allowing them to steal tasks from overloaded cores or a shared global queue, significantly improving CPU utilization. It also incorporates a starvation protection mechanism to ensure fairness, rescuing tasks that have waited beyond a threshold time. System performance is evaluated through standard scheduling metrics, including average waiting time, turnaround time, CPU utilization percentage, and standard deviation of waiting times to measure fairness.

This project provides a flexible platform for studying the trade-offs between efficiency and fairness in multicore scheduling. It highlights the challenges that arise when trying to optimize both throughput and equity among tasks. Future enhancements could include the development of more adaptive scheduling strategies that better balance task size, waiting time, and core capabilities.
